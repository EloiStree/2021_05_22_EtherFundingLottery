##  BIG Disclaimer

Before we start, I am explaining the concept and the coding it for the example.     
It does not means that I plan to use it, or used it (outside of checking if it works for science)  
   
If you use this kind of concept, you are in a gray zone of the justice that depending on the mood of your goverment could lead you to prison with heavy consequences.  
Please don't use this concept if you think it is illegal in your country.

# Idea

This respositroy is just a concept I through about that is crazy cool.

In Etherieum, we could have anonyme lottery:
- that are thrustable by any body on any machine at any time !
- and where the orginazer can if he want be totaly anonyme and untracable.
  - Meaning that if he want he can do it publicly with the authority and gov authorisation. But can decide to stay private if he fear goverment. Participants addresses are still trackable by the goverment but not the organizer.

You just need a computer somewhere in the world that check every x seconds the balance of a wallet and do the math and the transaction when an amount is reach.
And when the winner is declared. All participants can do the math and confirmed that the winner is the correct address !!!
